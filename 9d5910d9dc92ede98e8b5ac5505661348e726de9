      "message": "Yeah, all this does is prevent the \"authorize\" dialog from showing up, it\u0027s how the engineering bootloader accomplishes it as well. Normally adbd on the device detects when a USB adb connection has been made and then pops that dialog, but since that doesn\u0027t happen with the emulator then no dialog ever shows.",
